Difference between SQL and NoSQL database: 
1. SQL databases follow a relational model. NoSQL databases do not follow this model.
2. SQL databases use tables and records. NoSQL databases use collections and documents. 
3. NoSQL databases are designed to make joins difficult, and do not support this operation.
